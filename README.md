# Illumination
FRI Research at the Autonomous Robots Lab 2015 project
Requires Scipy, Pybrain, ROS, pip, numpy, possibly plotly
Agent will traverse its maintenance route and drop markers where it detects that some lights are broken 
Support Vector Machines(sklearn) and Artificial Neural Networks(pybrain) are used for the classification model.
Data is obtained through using the kinect on the agent.
